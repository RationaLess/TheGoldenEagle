# To ensure the game rule 'monument_effects' works properly, new monument buildings added should be given the optional base methods
# 	pm_monument_prestige_only
#	pm_monument_no_effects
# 
# 'monument_effects' additionally needs to be amended with flags disabling the new monument's Base method
# PM Groups for Monuments should have the 'is_hidden_when_unavailable' flag to ensure only one alternative is visible at any time (unless the player actually has an option they can switch to)
