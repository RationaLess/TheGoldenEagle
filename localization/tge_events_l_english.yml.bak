 tepaneca_war.1.f:0 "The Azcapotzalco palace once bolstered by the riches of tribute now sees a puny king swearing fealty to the Mexica, surrounded by the very Eagle Warriors who managed to siege his seemingly untouchable city.

 urbanization_efforts.1.f:"The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('anti_urbanist_ig').GetName] have long thought we should look to the past to learn how we should be. But they forgot about the very thing that led the Toltecs to achieve greatness we can only reminisce about -- ambition."

 urbanization_efforts.2.t:"The [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] Failure"
 urbanization_efforts.2.d:"The urbanization efforts pushed by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('urbanist_one_ig').GetName] have come to nothing long years after proposal. This will likely reinforce [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('anti_urbanist_ig').GetName] sentiment."
 urbanization_efforts.2.f:"'The enthusiasm burned bright but was short lived. [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] remains unremarkable and unknown; it will never come close to the likes of Chichen Itza or Tula. We were foolish to even think we could come close.'"

 urbanization_efforts.3.f:"'A mixtec man and mayab woman are bartering over fine local pottery - a common occurence in the [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] market. Poets sing their ballads, traders peddle their goods, scholars come to share knowledge and inspect local codices. It is impossibly lively compared to twenty years ago.'"
 urbanization_efforts.3.a:"Our cultural dominance is nigh."

 forging_alliances.1.f:"Warmongers all around us are subjugating cities en masse, wishing they could become the next great empire. We may not be able to do much about them alone, but thankfully we aren't the only ones facing this predicament."
 forging_alliances.1.a:"Perhaps its time for a different strategy."
 confederations_unlocked:"For as long as this [Concept('concept_journal_entry','$concept_journal_entry$')] is active, you may ask neighboring states to confederate."
