 interest_group_change.1.t:"A New Role"
 interest_group_change.1.d:"As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown in size, it's become clear that [GetIdeology('ideology_confederation_builders').GetName] will not see their ambitious through."

It is no longer a question of confederation - it's a question of tribute or vassalage, lest they be absorbed into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] structure."
 interest_group_change.1.a:"A more [GetIdeology('ideology_pragmatic').GetName] approach is long due."
